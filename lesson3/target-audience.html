            <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
            <p>Our target audience is individuals ages 15-60 who would be turing to the internet for weather predictions and information.</p>
            <h3>Personas:</h3>
            <p>Persona one: Fred is an avid traveler and packs his bags meticulously for each day of his trips. He is traveling to South Carolina next week (early February) and wants to know if he'll need to bring a coat and closed toed shoes, or if he can save the space and bring only long sleeve shirts and his sandals.</p>
            <p>Persona two: Jackie is 17 and is going to Washington D.C. for a cheer competition in March. She needs to know what to wear to the airport in her hometown, and also wants to know if her team will need their joggers or can get away with just their regular uniforms that week.</p>
            <h3>Scenarios:</h3>
            <p>Do I need to bring long pants to Hawaii in January?</p>
            <p>Can I get away with wearing tennis shoes to school today? Or should I wear boots?</p>
            <p>Will it be warm enough to take my kids to the park tomorrow?</p>
            <p>Is my family in Texas suffering through the cold this week too?</p>
            <p>Is the 4th of July parade going to get rained out?</p>
